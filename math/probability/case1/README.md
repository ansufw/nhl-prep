# Study Case #1

A manufacturing company produces ball bearings. The diameter of these ball bearings is known to follow a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 10 mm and a standard deviation of 0.1 mm.

- What percentage of ball bearings will have a diameter between 9.8 mm and 10.2 mm?
- If you randomly select a ball bearing, what is the probability that its diameter is less than 9.7 mm?
